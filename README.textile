h1. Rebar Templates

h2. Overview

This might really only be useful for me, but I thought I would share the Rebar templates that I have 
written to streamline my Erlang development.

So far it only consists of an ejabberd module template.

h2. Notes

If you don't already you can clone this Git repository in your ${HOME}/.rebar/templates directory, i.e.:

<pre>
<code>
 $ git clone git://github.com/mbbx6spp/rebar-templates.git ~/.rebar/templates
</code>
</pre>
(Thanks "@dizzyd":http://twitter.com/dizzyd for the pointer.)

Alternatively you can add this as a submodule under ${PROJECT_ROOT}/priv/templates if you want to use 
these templates just for a particular project.
